# 🧠 FaceFinder — AI-Based Face Recognition System

FaceFinder is an AI-powered face recognition system designed to identify and match users based on facial features.  
It enables finding possible Instagram profiles (or other identities) from an uploaded face image — with user consent for ethical use.  

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **AI Face Matching:** Detects and compares facial features using facial embeddings.  
- 🧑‍💻 **User Registration:** Upload 1–3 selfies with your Instagram handle to register your identity.  
- 📸 **Smart Image Preview:** Real-time preview of uploaded images before submission.  
- 💾 **Face Embedding Storage:** Saves face encodings in MongoDB for fast and scalable search.  
- 🔒 **Privacy & Consent:** Identification works only with user consent.  
- 🌐 **Responsive Interface:** Built using Bootstrap and EJS for a clean user experience.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:**  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Bootstrap  

**Backend:**  
- Node.js, Express.js  

**AI & Face Detection:**  
- Python (face_recognition, OpenCV, NumPy)  

**Database:**  
- MongoDB (via Mongoose)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FaceFinder.git
cd FaceFinder
````

### 2️⃣ Install Node.js Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Set Up Python Dependencies

Make sure Python is installed, then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install face_recognition opencv-python numpy
```

### 4️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add:

```
MONGO_URI = your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT = 5000
```

### 5️⃣ Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

Then open your browser and visit:
👉 [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **User Registration:**
   Users upload 1–3 selfies and their Instagram handle.
   The backend extracts facial embeddings using Python and stores them in MongoDB.

2. **Face Search:**
   When a new image is uploaded on the main page, FaceFinder computes the face encoding and compares it against all stored embeddings.

3. **Matching Results:**
   If a match is found, the associated Instagram handle is displayed on the result page.
