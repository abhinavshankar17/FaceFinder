### 🔍 Overview

**FaceFinder** is an AI-powered face recognition demo designed to identify and match users based on facial embeddings.  
It enables finding possible Instagram profiles (or other identities) from an uploaded photo — with **user consent first**.  
The system uses **DeepFace (FaceNet)** to extract embeddings, compares them using **cosine similarity**, and stores results securely in **MongoDB**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧬 **AI Face Matching:** Detects and compares facial features using DeepFace embeddings.
- 🙋‍♂️ **User Registration:** Upload 1–3 selfies with your Instagram handle to register your identity.
- 🖼️ **Smart Image Preview:** Real-time preview of uploaded images before submission.
- 💾 **Face Embedding Storage:** Saves numeric face vectors in MongoDB for efficient search.
- 🔒 **Privacy & Consent:** Identification works **only with user opt-in**; no scraping or third-party data.
- 🌐 **Responsive Interface:** Built with Bootstrap and EJS for a clean, mobile-friendly user experience.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Frontend:**  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- EJS  
- Bootstrap  

**Backend:**  
- Node.js  
- Express.js  

**AI / ML Layer:**  
- Python (Flask microservice)  
- DeepFace (FaceNet-style CNN embeddings)  

**Database:**  
- MongoDB  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User Registration:**  
   - User enters Instagram handle and uploads 1–3 selfies.  
   - Each image is sent to a Python Flask service for embedding extraction via DeepFace.  
   - The generated embeddings are stored in MongoDB under the user’s profile.

2. **Search & Matching:**  
   - A new uploaded image is converted to an embedding.  
   - Cosine similarity is computed against all stored user embeddings.  
   - The most similar profile (if any) is displayed with a similarity score.

3. **Architecture Summary:**
   - **Frontend:** EJS + Bootstrap for clean upload and preview UI.  
   - **Backend:** Node.js/Express handles uploads and DB interaction.  
   - **AI Layer:** Flask microservice returns embeddings via API.  
   - **Storage:** MongoDB stores user data and embedding arrays.

## 🧠 Learning Highlights

- Integrated a **Node.js + Python hybrid system** using Axios and Flask.  
- Understood **facial embeddings** and how they enable vector-based similarity search.  
- Implemented **Multer** for local uploads and dynamic preview rendering.  
- Explored **privacy-first design** principles in AI-driven applications.

## ⚖️ Ethics & Safety

This project is intended **solely for educational and research purposes**.
Real-world face search systems can pose serious **privacy, consent, and misuse risks**.
FaceFinder ensures:

* Only **opt-in users** are discoverable.
* Images are **stored temporarily** and deleted post-processing.
* Embeddings can be hashed or anonymized for ethical deployment.

---

## 📅 Future Improvements

* Fine-tune face detection models for better robustness.
* Add confidence thresholds for “possible matches.”
* Introduce a consent dashboard and audit logs.
* Enable on-device embedding extraction to reduce data exposure.
